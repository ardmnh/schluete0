Drop shadow for grouped cells in a table view
=============================================

This project demonstrates how to add a drop shadow to the cells of a grouped table 
view by just using the shadow and the mask property of CALayer.

The effect could also be achieved by using images in a custom UITableViewCell, but 
this prevents effective resizing of table cells in fade in/out animations.
